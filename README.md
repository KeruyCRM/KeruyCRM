# No Laravel. No React. No Bootstrap. Full freedom from dictators.

It's not another framework with a thousand dependencies and a rigid architecture.
It's a flexible and simple CMF built for developers who don't need anyone to tell them how to do things right.

Build your CRM, ERP, WMS and any back-end system the way you want.
Based on the time-tested Fat-Free Framework (F3) and concise EasyUI - a lightweight SPA interface suite.

* No builds, webpacks and npm
* Minimum code - maximum control
* Transparent architecture without magic
* Only what you need - and nothing extra

## You don't adapt to KeruyCRM. KeruyCRM adapts to you.
